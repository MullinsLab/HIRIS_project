ToDo:
    Work out user permissions
    Update data structures to support user permissions
    Update data structures to support freezing
        Add freeze table
        Duplicate data used in the freeze
            or version data instead?
    Work out what's stored in the JSON fields
        Pull data out of JSON fields?
    Set up tests  

Questions:
    Is there value in versioning the data instead of freezing?  How often is data updated in a project?
    Are there reasons to freeze a data set other than when it gets reorientated to a different version of the Human Genome?
